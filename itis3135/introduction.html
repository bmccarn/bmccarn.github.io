            <li><span class="bolded">Personal background</span>: I was born and raised in the Charlotte area. I joined
                the military in 2015 and had
                the opportunity to live in numerous places all over the world. I separated from active duty in March of
                2021 and enlisted in the North Carolina Air National Guard. I began my educational journey here at UNCC
                in May of 2021.</li>
            <li><span class="bolded">Professional</span>: I have spent the past 6 years as a K-9 handler in the Air
                Force.</li>
            <li><span class="bolded">Academic background</span>: I have my Associate's Degree in Criminal Justice. I am
                currently pursuing my B.S.
                in Computer Science with a Data Science Minor. I plan to pursue a M.S. in Cybersecurity after
                graduating.</li>
            <li><span class="bolded">Background in the subject matter of this course</span>: I've had an interest in
                computers my entire life.
                Learning how things work behind the scenes has always fascinated me so I decided to pursue a degree in
                Computer Science.

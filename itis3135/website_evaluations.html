            <h3><a href="https://www.apple.com">Apple</a></h3>
            <p>
            <div class="center-text">
                This is the website of the tech giant, Apple.
            </div>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="bolded">Contrast:</span>Apple does a great job with contrast on their website. The
                    colors of the font stand out nicely
                    against the background. It is very east to read and and pleasing to look at.</li>
                <li><span class="bolded">Repetition:</span> There is very little repetition when it comes to the colors,
                    layouts and information on the pages.
                    It seems very well thought out and has been implemented well.</li>
                <li><span class="bolded">Alignment:</span> They have done a very good job of centering what needs to be
                    centered and aligning other items
                    where they need to be. Nothing seems awkardly placed and everything seems to be placed with a
                    purpose.</li>
                <li><span class="bolded">Proximity:</span> The content on the pages is spaced well. The pages don't seem
                    to be crowded when looking through
                    the website.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><a href="https://www.art.yale.edu">Yale School of Art</a></h3>
            <p>
            <div class="center-text">
                This is the website of the Yale School of Art...an absolute eyesore.
            </div>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="bolded">Contrast:</span> Yale has done an absolutely terrible job with this website.
                    The contrast is somewhat there in
                    parts, but for the most part it is an eyesore. Many of the text blocks blend into the dark
                    background making it very hard to read.</li>
                <li><span class="bolded">Repetition:</span> The repetition on this website is awful. Mainly the black
                    and white text blocks that are seen
                    consistently throughout the homepage. There should be some variety to the content.</li>
                <li><span class="bolded">Alignment:</span> The alignment on the website is possibly the worst thing
                    about it. The title of the homepage
                    isn't centered and everything seems to be left justified.</li>
                <li><span class="bolded">Proximity:</span> The proximity of the material is very bad. The blocks of
                    content on the homepage are randomly
                    spaced from each other. This makes it very hard to follow along and make sense of what the
                    links/content is for.</li>
            </ul>

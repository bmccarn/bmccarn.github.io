        <h2>About Us</h2>

        <p>For a couple of years now I have been on an otherworldly adventure that has caused a move in my spirit. I
            began to feel that as my point of view on life developed, my motivation for taking photos didn’t impact me
            any longer. It, as of late, hit me that my explanations behind adoring photography could advance inside me
            also.</p>

        <p>I used to take pictures trying to stop time. I felt frantic to clutch past recollections, instead of living
            in the now. In the long run I understood that I need to take pictures not to look back, but rather with an
            end goal to appreciate the present minute.</p>

        <p>When I glance back at old photos, I would prefer not to feel that mixed sentimentality for what used to be.
        </p>

        <p>I would rather be appreciative for the things I have in my present life… the
            associations, the delight, the adorations that I have today.</p>
